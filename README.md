# Grade-Optimizer
Life is a balance between lots of different things that require time and energy. Sometimes you have to make the decision of what is the most valuable use of those limited resources. This program will help you make a more informed decision on if those extra hours on that paper are worth the risk of being late for work in the morning.

### How to Use
Add each of the assignments for a given class into the tracker before you start. Once you have completed an assignment add the actual grade to that assignment in the tracker and it will be locked in at that grade during calculations. All blank grades are considered future assignments and are variables for the optimizer. Once a value is changed and the cell has lost focus, the tracker will update the calculations at the bottom to tell you what you need to make on all the remaining assignments to get a 90, 80, or 70. A value of 0 means that grade is guaranteed. A value of 100+ means you better hope for some extra credit points.

#### Disclaimer
Don't be lazy. Don't strive for barely passing. You're only hurting yourself if you don't push to become better. You should try to get a 100 on everything but in the real world its not always possible.
